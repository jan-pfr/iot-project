# IoT Project - Smart Home Automation

This repository contains the final project for the elective course 'Internet of Things' lectured by Prof. Dr. Edgar Seemann at the Furtwangen University (HFU) in Germany.
The goal of this final project is to create a virtual smart home automation system simulating a complete MQTT network. The MQTT data is being cached by an HTTP server (that also serves as MQTT sub client in order to get said MQTT data) and made available via HTTP. The UI is implemented in HTML/CSS with supportive frameworks such as Font Awesome, jQuery and more. Everything runs locally and requires no further changes to run.
